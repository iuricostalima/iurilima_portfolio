Google Data Studio is a great free tool for creating interactive dashboards and beautiful reports.
This is a simple visualization of the Covid19 cases and deaths in the state of California.





### Miscellaneous Programming

[QrCode Generator in Python](https://github.com/iuricostalima/QrCode/blob/main/QrCode_Generator.ipynb)

iuricostalima/QrCode is a ✨ special ✨ repository because it's one of my most useful tools. I've learnt about QrCode and since then I am trying to make good use of it, helping friends and family improve their business and connections.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/iuricostalima/iurilima_portifolio/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
